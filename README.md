Auxgrep's gateway to forward local port via cloud vps - onfly tunnel - SSH (DEMO)

# ABOUT 
This allows anyone on the remote server to connect to TCP port **** on the remote server. The connection will then be tunneled back to the client host, and the client then makes a TCP connection to port **** on localhost.
Edit this script add your server IP or domain name then your ready to rock!!! happy tunneling
